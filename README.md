This project is a Java console application designed to generate strong, random passwords and provide a robust password strength checker. It was developed as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming and addresses the critical need for secure password management.

Introduction
During my second year, after completing a course on Object-Oriented Effective Java Programming, I wanted to apply my skills to a practical project. Inspired by the importance of strong passwords, which I often discussed with family and friends, I decided to build a tool that could both generate secure, random passwords and assess the strength of existing ones. This project was a significant milestone in my development journey, as it was one of the first substantial applications I built entirely on my own.

Key Functionalities
Secure Password Generation: The application interactively prompts the user for preferences regarding password length and character inclusion (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). It then constructs a password alphabet based on these choices to generate a completely random and customized password.

Comprehensive Password Strength Check: The program evaluates a password based on a set of objective criteria, including the use of various character types and password length. It calculates a score and provides a clear strength rating (weak, medium, good, great) to the user.

User Information and Best Practices: A minor but valuable feature is the display of a curated list of password security best practices. This educational component informs the user about common pitfalls, such as using dictionary words, character repetition, or keyboard patterns.
